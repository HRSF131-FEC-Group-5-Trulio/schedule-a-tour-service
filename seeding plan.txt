We need to generate realistic looking data, for 100 primary records.

Inputs: Number or records, options for the data
Output: Number of records
Constraints: None, faster is better
Edge Cases: Images, ?

One to One:
Each record is linked to one attribute.
Create a record. Create another. Repeate until I have enough.
  Creat a record
  Input: options for the data
  Output: The record
  C, E: None for now.

  Define the fields I need.
  Create 'random' information for each field (does not need to be random, but of the generally correct type)
  1. Iterate across an array or options
  2. Use Math.random()
  3. Use faker.js

  Images: Use Amazon S3 to store the images, and then keep url to S3 in the database.

One to Many: (Linked tables or nesting)
Crate a record, Create all the linked or nested records. Create another primary record. Create its related records. Repeate until I have enough.

Many to Many:
